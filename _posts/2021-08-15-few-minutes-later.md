Yeah, it's been a while since I did this.  

Felt like I should write down the things I learnt on the job, clearly learnt a lot more than college atleast.  
So I would be writing some pages (short ones, mind you) since I don't wanna write too long, for reminiscence and as a lesson for me in the future.
I started with React on the job.
