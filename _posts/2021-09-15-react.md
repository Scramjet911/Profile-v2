So at the beginning, I was more into backend, since making a whole system design from the ground up is very interesting, instead of making the UI element a bit more to the left.  
(Future Me [fm]. Hey, future me here. I might say a lot of stupid stuff but please chalk it up to inexperience. It was only later that I realized, building a scalable frontend architecture, is also a bit of a challenge.)

I started working on a merchant portal called Tokko (fm: later Lummo and so on).  
The first thing that shocked me in this project is something called ESLint. It is amazingly helpful in not making obvious mistakes. (fm: it sounds crazy for someone experienced, but I had never used linting tools before that)  
It is only with such tools that I realized how easy life could be. Plain JS is a pain in the a** to work with. (fm: and I never looked back)

This was also the first time (fm: yeah I didn't research much it seems) I am working with typescript. I love it, since it reminds me of C++.  
I love programming in C++, since it gives the user a lot more control over the program. Though it has a problem of being complicated compared to something like javascript or python.



That incident with tracking and function signatures being same in tokko after compilation but different during development
