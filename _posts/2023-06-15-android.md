Android, the thing all developers have tried (atleast thought of trying) once. These are the <i>craziest</i> waters of the development world (sounds foreboding).  
Well, I moved to an android project and started learning kotlin.  

The main thing I realized was that the Android build process sucks. The number of cache issues really blows my mind, coming from a web background, the web development world is miles ahead in debugging, building and deploying things. Expected since it is an old tech.  
I came upon the app/sdk using cached sdk versions multiple times during development and it was so annoying that I made a [script](https://github.com/Scramjet911/Salvator-scripts/blob/main/React%20Native/react_native_package_repack.py) to automate the build and loading of the package into a sample app.  

After sometime I got used to it though, and now I am pretty ok with the android ecosystem and its issues.
