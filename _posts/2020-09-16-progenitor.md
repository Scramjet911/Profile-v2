<strong>It all began with winning a coding competition.</strong> You see, I love solving problems, so naturally I took a liking to competitive coding. 

It was the prize of the competition that surprised me, usually you get money or coupons (I hate those...) but this time it was different. We got to do an open source project of our choice under the guidance of a mentor they provided. Working on small projects was nothing new to me, but getting the guidance of someone actually experienced in the field was really amazing.

So, I teamed up with 3 others and decided on the topic. The project we decided on was a website that helps Coders by providing a platform for discussion, finding resources and articles, chatting with others and with coding events they could participate in.

With the topic decided we got a mentor, Mr Akshay, who faced an uphill battle of guiding us inexperienced noobs, and help us create this website. In our group we only had one guy who was slightly familiar with web dev (It wasn't me &#128540;)  
The stack we decided to work on was Nodejs and ExpressJs for the backend, Reactjs and Nextjs for frontend and Mongodb (Mongoose) as our database.

So started My Grand Journey through the world of Website Development.
