### The premise
We made a react native (android focused) package which used the OpenCV Laplacian filter to detect blurring in images. I will write about that in another post.  
So, the client liked the package functionality, but they had a problem. The app size was huge, 150mb on integrating the package into the app.  

We knew that the package would have a large size, since the OpenCV libs were that large. Just the opencv aar package was 75mb.  
Now, the only way to reduce it's size was to take a custom build of OpenCV, since it made up the bulk of the app size. (I'm getting excited just thinking about this....)  
I love getting challenging tasks ðŸ˜Ž   

***This is part 1 of the series for a custom opencv build.  
Part 1 is mainly about the docker env, one can do it locally (by installing the same dependencies and changing RUN for sudo), but I didn't want to take a chance on dependency conflicts (If I needed multiple versions and all).***

### The target
So I had a week, to setup the C++ environment and build OpenCV. Now, I have heard that there are dependency conflicts (usually) when building C++ programs (because of system dependencies clashing with required dependencies). Now take everything I say with a pinch of salt because this is the first time I am cross compiling a software.  

So the first thing to do is to avoid dependency conflicts, the first thing that came to mind was a docker container.  
It is independent of the file system, and acts like a virtual environment (obviously it is much more capable than that) for me.  
Thus I built a container for it.  
I decided to go for an ubuntu base, since after a lot of research I found that alpine doesn't have support (from what I could find) for multilib, since it uses `musl` and not `glibc`(used by ubuntu). Therefore it is easier to use the ubuntu base, although the size of the image would increase.  

Next we need to install the dependencies. So the dockerfile would look like this

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

COPY ./ndk/android-ndk-r26c /app/ndk

# ---------------------------- Build dependencies install -----------------------------------
# Installing dependencies, might have some unnecessary ones but didn't have time to check each one
RUN apt-get -y update
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt \
    apt-get install -y build-essential checkinstall cmake pkg-config yasm \
    git gfortran \
    libjpeg8-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev \
    libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libdc1394-dev \
    libxine2-dev libv4l-dev

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt \
    apt-get install -y gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-opencv \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-good \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-tools \
    libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
    libgstreamer1.0-0 libgstreamer1.0-dev

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt \
    apt-get install -y libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libtbb-dev \
    libatlas-base-dev \
    libfaac-dev libmp3lame-dev libtheora-dev \
    libvorbis-dev libxvidcore-dev \
    libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev \
    x264 v4l-utils

# Can remove python-is-python3 if python becomes default in ubuntu
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt \
    apt-get install -y qt6-base-dev \
    apt-get install -y ninja-build ant python-is-python3

```
One might wonder what the `--mount=type=cache,target=/var/cache/apt` part of the run command does, since `Run` commands are cached by default. Well 

This takes care of all the dependencies needed to build just opencv (It is a lot, I know).  
We also need to install android build tools, needed to compile opencv for android. 
Thank you [@thyrlian](https://github.com/thyrlian) for [this script](https://github.com/thyrlian/AndroidSDK/blob/master/android-sdk/license_accepter.sh)  
I shamelessly copied it from his `android-sdk` docker image.

And finally.. What we all were waiting for...  
Oh-my-zsh support ðŸ˜œ. We can't be using the crummy old regular terminal amiright?  
Well actually I installed it because I needed the autocomplete for the commands I ran.  
One can skip it if not needed.

```

We're done with setting up the container!
